# Decision-Making-Logic-Taxonomy
It is aimed to discover the decision-making nature of activities, called Decision-Making Logic (DML) level. We use the following DML levels: routine, semi-cognitive and cognitive. For this purpose, first, we compile a DML taxonomy. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm, we identify most important keywords in the text corpus. Each of the keywords is associated with a DML level. While organizing identified keywords into one of the three DML levels, we consider diverse semantic concepts of business processes: Resources, Techniques, Capacities, and Choices, elements of RTCC framework. We designed contextual variables (see DML_Taxonomy/Decision_Making_Logic_Taxonomy.pdf), based on which experts categorized words into one of the three DML levels and one of the four semantic concepts.

This repository contains the following files: tasks typology vocabulary (types and subtypes), python files for identifying tasks types and tasks subtypes (as an input for python files serve tasks textual descriptions and tasks typology taxonomy), excel file with the motivating example and illustrative tasks typology taxonomy.

Below, we describe the main stages of Step 4. Typology Aspect Extraction.
