# Decision-Making-Logic-Taxonomy
It is aimed to discover the decision-making nature of activities, called Decision-Making Logic (DML) level. We use the following DML levels: routine, semi-cognitive and cognitive. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm, we identify most important keywords. Each of the keywords is associated with a DML level. While organizing identified keywords into one of the three DML levels, we consider diverse semantic concepts: Resources, Techniques, Capacities, and Choices, elements of RTCC framework. We designed contextual variables (see DML Framework document), based on which experts categorized words into one of the three DML levels and one of the four semantic concepts.
